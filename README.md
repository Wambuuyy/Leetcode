1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]




2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 

Example 1:


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

Hint
You are given a 0-indexed binary string s having an even length.

A string is beautiful if it's possible to partition it into one or more substrings such that:

Each substring has an even length.
Each substring contains only 1's or only 0's.
You can change any character in s to 0 or 1.

Return the minimum number of changes required to make the string s beautiful.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1001"
Output: 2
Explanation: We change s[1] to 1 and s[3] to 0 to get string "1100".
It can be seen that the string "1100" is beautiful because we can partition it into "11|00".
It can be proven that 2 is the minimum number of changes needed to make the string beautiful.
Example 2:

Input: s = "10"
Output: 1
Explanation: We change s[1] to 1 to get string "11".
It can be seen that the string "11" is beautiful because we can partition it into "11".
It can be proven that 1 is the minimum number of changes needed to make the string beautiful.
Example 3:

Input: s = "0000"
Output: 0
Explanation: We don't need to make any changes as the string "0000" is beautiful already.
 

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 105
s has an even length.
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
